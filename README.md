## Systems Programming - Assignment 7
## C/Network Program
### Abstract
In computer science, the [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them. Formulated in 1965 by Edsger Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, and later adapted by Tony Hoare to become the problem that we know of today.

Written in C, this problem uses threads and uses no sephamores and locking mutex.  Uses instructors random library.
